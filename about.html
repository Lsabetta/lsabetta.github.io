        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hey there! I'm just your average ex-particle-physics researcher turned AI enthusiast with a taste for adventure, both in and out of the lab. My academic journey kicked off at the University of Rome La Sapienza – yep, that's in the beautiful heart of Italy. That's where I got hooked on the mysteries of the universe and dived deep into particle physics. Oh, and I also started my Ph.D. there, which was pretty cool.</p>
	
	<p>The plot twist? I spent a year at CERN during my Ph.D. Imagine being in the Avengers headquarters, but for physics. It was an eye-opener, working with people from all corners of the globe. Turns out, mixing with a bunch of different minds and cultures does wonders – it's like getting a front-row seat to the world while geeking out over quarks and leptons.</p>
	
	<p>But here's where things took a turn – after wrapping up my Ph.D. in particle physics, I followed my gut straight into the world of AI. I landed at Leonardo Labs, diving into this whole new universe of continual learning and machine unlearning in computer vision. And guess what? Now I'm exploring how to apply these cool AI tricks to Large Language Models. It's a wild ride, but I'm loving every bit of it.</p>
	
	<p>When I'm not tangled up in algorithms, you can find me hitting the slopes, skiing like there's no tomorrow, or indulging in my inner powerlifting champ – though those competition days are a bit behind me. And for a dash of extra flavor, I'm all about painting minis, shuffling Magic decks, and rolling dice in Dungeons and Dragons. Because why not?</p>
	
	<p>Life's a blend of physics, AI, and a whole lot of fun on the side. Stick around, and let's see where this journey takes us!</p>
